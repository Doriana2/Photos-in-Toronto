Create an app that shows a map centered on downtown Toronto, and an input
search box for the user.
When the user enters a search, use the “term” and “geo” query params to only
return photos within 50 km of downtown Toronto.
For each photo returned, place a marker on the maps. Add an info window to
the marker that shows the photo and some information about the photo when
the user clicks on the marker.
