This is an app that shows a map centered on downtown Toronto, and an input
search box for the user.
When the user enters a search, the “term” and “geo” query params are used to call 500px API endpoint and only
return photos within 50 km of downtown Toronto.
For each photo returned, a marker on the map is placed. An info window to
the marker that shows the photo and more details about the photo when
the user clicks on the marker is added.
The app is built from scratch using html5, css3, javascript, jquery and ajax.
